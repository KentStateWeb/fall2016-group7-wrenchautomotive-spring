  <h3> Oil and Oil Filter Service </h3>
  <p> Experts recommend changing the oil and oil filter in your vehicle every 3
     months or 3,000 miles, whichever is first. It’s an essential way to
     maximize engine protection. </p>

     <h4> Engine Oil </h4>
       <p> Engine oil is what lubricates a car’s engine, allowing it to run
         smoothly and last longer. Car owners must maintain their cars’
         engines by changing the oil and using the oil appropriate for their
         cars’ makes and models. Every car comes with a check oil light and
         an oil filter under the hood. These components allow car owners to
         monitor their oil levels and add oil as needed without having to
         hire a mechanic. </p>

         <blockquote>
           <h4> Tips and Advice </h4>
           <p> What causes milky brown engine oil? </p>
           <p> Milky brown engine oil is an indication of coolant in the oil.
             This can be caused by a blown head gasket or other gasket, a
             failed transmission cooler or cracked casings. This condition
             is very serious and needs to be checked by a professional
             technician quickly. </p>

  <p> What is synthetic motor oil? </p>
  <p> Synthetic motor oils are made of artificial materials. They can be a
    good choice for high output, turbocharged or supercharged engines, vehicles
     that are used for towing (especially during hot weather) or vehicles that
     are operated in extremely cold or hot climates. Synthetic motor oils,
     though several times more expensive than mineral-based motor oils, can
     improve fuel economy and provide longer intervals between changes. They
     also provide instant lubrication on start-up. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4> Changing the Oil </h4>
<p> An important part of routine car maintenance is changing the oil regularly.
   The necessary frequency of oil changes has become a point of contention among
   experts. To determine the best course oil maintenance on oil change is to
   check the owner’s manual and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. </p>

   <p> If the check engine oil light comes on when you’re driving, this is a
     strong indication that the car is running low on oil. If the oil light
     stays on or lights up shortly after adding oil, there may be a leak, and a
     mechanic should look at the car. </p>

<blockquote>
  <h4> Tips and Advice </h4>
  <p> When should I get my oil changed? </p>
  <p> You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in
    your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use
    oil that is capable of extended mileage changes. </p>
  </blockquote>

<h4> Cooling System Services </h4>
<h5> Cooling System Service </h5>
<p> We can flush your vehicle’s cooling system, perform a pressure test
  and check hoses, caps and connections. </p>

  <h5> Air Conditioning Service </h5>
  <p> One of our trained air conditioning specialists will inspect your car’s
    air conditioner, all lines, the evaporator and the compressor for
    leaks and wear. </p>

<h5> Driveline Service </h5>
<p> We will remove old, worn-out gear oil from the front and
      rear differential and transfer cases. </p>

<h5> Fuel/Air Induction Clean-up </h5>
<p> Using specialized equipment, our technicians will quickly and
        effectively clean the intake manifold, ports, intake valves and
        combustion chamber and install injector cleaning additives in your
        vehicle’s tank. This service will restore lost power and performance
        and will reduce harmful exhaust emissions. </p>

<h5> Power Steering Flush </h5>
<p> Our technicians use a powerful cleaner to dissolve gum and varnish
          in your car’s power steering unit. Next, we will flush old, worn-out,
          contaminated fluid and install fresh, new fluid fortified with a
          special antioxidant and anti-wear ingredients to prevent expensive
          mechanical failure. </p>

<h5> Transmission Service </h5>
<p> Using the latest in state-of-the-art technology, we will install
            a safe and effective cleaner to suspend harmful varnish and sludge
            from the transmission valve body, torque converter and lines and
            install new high-tech fluid with conditioners. </p>

<h4> Brake System Services </h4>
<p> Brakes are crucial to keeping you and your loved ones safe on the road.
  If you have ever had problems with your brakes, you can attest to the fact
  that it can be a terrible experience. </p>
  <p> By having your brakes inspected twice a year, you can protect yourself
    and your passengers, and you can save money by catching any problems before
    they become too costly.Inspecting your brakes twice a year for wear
    and damage can protect you and your passengers. Additionally, it will
    help you save money by catching any damage before it becomes too costly. </p>

    <h5> What do we check during our inspection of your brakes? </h5>
    <p> The master cylinder is the heart of your vehicle’s braking system,
      and it holds the brake fluid when it is not being delivered to the
      brakes through the brake lines. </p>

      <p> The brake fluid itself can become dirty or contaminated as it draws
        rust-causing moisture and picks up other debris, or it can break down
        from excess heat. Clean brake fluid is either clear or slightly yellow
        while dirty brake fluid may be brown or even black. Old and dirty brake
        fluid can damage brake systems internally. </p>

        <p> The brake lines connect to the master cylinder through a
          combination valve, which combines metering and proportioning valves.
          It regulates the pressure on the front and rear wheels to make sure
          both sets of brakes are applied simultaneously. A malfunctioning
          combination valve can cause the wheels to lock up. </p>

<p> Brake pads and shoes can be made of ceramic, metal or organic materials
  while the disk rotors and drums they press against are made of metal.
  Because pads and shoes create friction to stop the car, they gradually
  wear down over time and may wear away completely, letting the metal of the
  calipers and cylinders to which they are attached grind against the rotors
  and drums and damage them. Some pads have a metal strip attached to them
  that sounds a warning whistle when the pad becomes too worn, but this strip
   sounds only when the car is in motion and the brakes are not applied. </p>

<blockquote>
  <h4> Tips and Advice </h4>
  <p> How do I know when to replace my brakes? </p>
  <p> If you hear squeaks, squeals, grinding or other noises, there could be a
    problem. The exception to this rule is if your car has been exposed to
     moisture recently. Moisture can cause a thin layer of rust to develop,
     and slight squeaking immediately after rain is not unusual. If the
     squeaking continues, have your brakes inspected. Periodically check
     wear on your brake pads through the spaces between your wheels’ spokes.
     The outside pad will be pressed against a metal rotor, and there should
     be at least ¼ inch of pad. Any less, and you’ll want to have the pads
     inspected or replaced. </p>

</ul>
<p> We also carry various tire brands. Here are some of the
  tire brands that we carry: <p>


<blockquote>
  <h4> Tips and Advice </h4>
  <p> Why is it more expensive and time-consuming to have
    tires serviced rather than rotated? </p>
<p> Technicians use special diagnostic tools to test and recalibrate sensors
  any time a tire is moved from one location on the vehicle to another. A
  sensor must be tested to make sure it is functioning correctly and also
  must be reprogrammed whenever tires are moved from one position to another
   during rotation. OEMs recommend a sensor service kit be installed every
   time a tire is serviced. These kits include replacement parts to properly
   service the sensor. Sensors are powered by a battery that usually has a
   life of 6 to 8 years. The sensor has to be replaced when the battery fails
   because the sensor’s batteries are not replaceable. </p>

   <p> How often should I rotate my tires? </p>
   <p> Your tires should be rotated every other oil change or every 6,000 miles.
      Neglecting to rotate tires is a major cause of premature tire wear. </p>
