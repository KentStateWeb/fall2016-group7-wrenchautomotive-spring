        I recently had the team at Wrench Auto perform an engine replacement on my 1973 Corvette...not a minor repair to say the least. Todd, Brian, and the entire team were extremely professional, a pleasure to work with, and they did a fantastic job installing the new Jasper high performance engine. I would highly recommend Wrench Auto to anyone. <br><span class="customer">- Sean J.</span>

          Great service! I had my car at two other shops and it still had a check engine light. <br>Todd and Brian fixed it fast and inexpensive. Thanks! <br><span class="customer">- Joan W.</span>
