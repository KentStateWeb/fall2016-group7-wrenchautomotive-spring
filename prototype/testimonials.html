<h2> Customer Testimonials </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p> “Automotive Professionals
I have dealt with Todd, Brian and the rest of the team at Wrench for over 7
years. The best way to judge a shop is when your entire experience has been
completed you then ask yourself, “would I send my mother here to get her
repairs done?” I can answer “yes” to that question! I deal with 350 accounts
over a span of 7 different counties and have some idea of what people are
looking for and Wrench fits that model. They participate in all of Jasper
Engines & Transmissions technical and professional training. They are equipped
with all the latest tooling to be able to diagnose and repair your car in a
 professional manner. If I can recommend my mother there I can certainly
 recommend you as well.” </p>

   Jasper Engines & Transmissions Northeastern Ohio on Feb 25, 2015 </cite>

  <p> “Corvette Repair
I recently had the team at Wrench Auto perform an engine replacement on my 1973
 Corvette...not a minor repair to say the least. Todd, Brian, and the entire
 team were extremely professional, a pleasure to work with, and they did a
 fantastic job installing the new Jasper high performance engine. I would
 highly recommend Wrench Auto to anyone.” </p>
